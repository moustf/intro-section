- You can click the code drop-down menu as illustrated in the picture above and copy the link to clone the repo.
- Now go to the terminal and type: `git clone <the link here>` and then the repo will be cloned to your local machine.
- By now you have to open your IDE -I recommend VSCode- and open the project.
- to open a live page from your local machine project, you can download the `live Server` extension. This's a [link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) to the extension.
- Now right click with your mouse and choose: Open with live server.
